## contribution
I have some experience in AI field and completed a program about translation model from French to English based on transformer model. 
What's more, I'm a student of Information Technology and I have enough knowledge background of IT.
Finally, I'm interested in meeting new friends and have meaningful communication with excellent people to expand our view.
I'm interested in multimodal technique in AI area of NLP and computer vision program or other programing field, maybe I can be beneficial to the team's growth.
